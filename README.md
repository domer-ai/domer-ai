# Domer: Turn Your Ideas Into Images in Seconds

I've tested at least a dozen AI image generators over the past few months, and honestly? Most feel like you need a PhD just to get started. Domer's different—in a good way.

## What Is Domer?

Domer is an AI image generator that actually makes sense. You type what you want, it generates the image. Simple as that.

The platform runs on two main models right now: Z-Image Turbo for text to image creation, and Seedream 4.5 (from Bytedance) for image to image transformations. Both deliver results in 5-30 seconds, which beats waiting around for minutes like some competitors make you do.

What caught my attention? Their credit system doesn't expire. Buy credits once, use them whenever. That's rare—most platforms force monthly subscriptions or let your credits vanish after 30 days.

## How It Works

Here's the actual workflow:

**For Text to Image:**
1. Type your prompt (up to 5000 characters if you're feeling wordy)
2. Pick your aspect ratio—10 options from square to ultra-wide
3. Hit generate
4. Download your image

Takes maybe 20 seconds total.

**For Image to Image:**
Upload up to 4 reference images, add text describing what you want changed, and let the AI do its thing. I used this to transform a basic sketch into a polished character design. Worked better than expected.

## Key Features Worth Mentioning

**Multiple Aspect Ratios:** 16:9, 5:4, 4:3, 3:2, 1:1, 2:3, 3:4, 4:5, 9:16, and 21:9. Covers pretty much any social media format you'd need.

**Privacy Controls:** Toggle between public gallery sharing or keeping creations private. Most AI video generator and image tools don't bother with this.

**Fair Pricing:** Free tier gives you 10 credits to test things out (that's 5 text to image generations). Paid plans start at $9.99/month for 200 credits. Do the math—that's $0.05 per credit, way cheaper than comparable platforms.

**Pay Once Option:** Not ready to commit? The PayGo package is $7.99 for 100 credits. These expire in 90 days, but it's perfect for one-off projects.

## FAQ

**Q: Can I use Domer for commercial projects?**
Yes. Images you create are yours to use.

**Q: What payment methods does Domer accept?**
Credit cards via Stripe, plus crypto payments through Creem. Not many AI generators offer crypto, which is cool if that's your thing.

**Q: Do unused credits disappear?**
Nope. Subscription credits stick around forever (except PayGo's 90-day limit). This is huge if you don't generate images every single day.

**Q: Will there be text to video or image to video features?**
Based on their roadmap, video generation is coming in 2025. They're planning Runway Gen-3 and Luma Dream Machine integration.

**Q: How fast is generation?**
5-30 seconds for images. Actual time depends on complexity and server load.

## Why Choose Domer?

Look, I'm not going to claim Domer is perfect for everyone. If you need 100% control over every pixel, you probably want Stable Diffusion running locally.

But if you want an ai image generator that works without reading a manual first, gives you decent pricing, and doesn't delete your credits every month—yeah, Domer makes sense.

The interface feels responsive, generation quality is solid (especially for the price), and customer support actually responds when you have questions.

## Ready to Start?

Head to [Domer.io](https://domer.io) and grab your 10 free credits. No credit card needed for the trial. Test it with a few prompts, see if the quality matches your needs.

If you're working on content that needs consistent AI-generated images, the Pro plan at $19.99/month (500 credits) hits a sweet spot between affordability and volume.
